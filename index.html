                <div class="env-text" id="text2">Drawing inspiration from the game Journey By Thatgamecompany and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in both visual style (cartoonish 3D) and gameplay mechanics, 
                    Distant Wind is as much a game that heavily emphasises movement and environment traversal as it is a piece of artistic media.
                </div>
                <div class="env-text" id="text4"> Although this pitch is in a top-down 2D format, the general 'feel'
                    as well as collectible-driven nature very much parallels our intentions for Distant Wind. Not only does this freedom of exploration and travel allow for a unique approach to
                    storytelling, but also heavily backs the aim of the story - to portray human life from an objective perspective.</div>
