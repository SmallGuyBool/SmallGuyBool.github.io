                <div class="env-text" id="text2">Drawing inspiration from the game Journey By Thatgamecompany and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in both visual style (stylised 3d) and gameplay mechanics, 
                    Distant Wind is as much a game that heavily emphasises movement and environment traversal as it is a piece of artistic media.
                </div>
                <div class="env-text" id="text4">Not only does this freedom allow for a unique approach to
                    storytelling, but also heavily backs the artistic aim of portraying the place that people have the universe.</div>
